                    God
                </h2>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    We believe that there is one true God. One in essence, nature, and attributes,
                    but exists in three personalities (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit).
                    We believe that this triune God has revealed himself as the eternally,
                    self-existence ‘THE GREAT I AM, creator of heaven and earth and the
                    redeemer of all mankind. (Deuteronomy 6:4, Isaiah 43:10-11, Mathew
                    1:21-23, 3:17, John 14:10-11, Luke 3:22, John 4:24, 1 John 5:5-7).

                    The Bible
                </h2>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    We believe that the Bible is the inspired, inerrant (without error) word of God,
                    and that is the final check for doctrine, reproof, correction, and for instruction
                    in all righteousness.
                    We believe that the Bible has the same power today as it ever had and that
                    no man may ever add thereto or may take therefrom except to their own
                    detriment (consequence). (2Timothy 3:15-16, 2 Peter 1:19-22, 1Peter
                    1:23-25).

                    Jesus Christ
                </h2>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    We believe that Jesus Christ is the begotten son of God. he was born of the
virgin Mary according to the holy scriptures, suffered under the hands of a
cruel government and religious systems of his day, and that was killed on the
cross, buried, and resurrected on the third day. He ascended to heaven and is
seated on the right-hand side of the father.
We believe that this same Jesus will come again at the end of the age in a
physical form and every eye shall see him. There will be the resurrection of
the just in Christ to eternal life and those who may have refused him to eternal
damnation. We believe that his blood was shed for the remission of our sins.
He is therefore the only savior and redeemer of all mankind.

                    The Church
                </h2>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    We believe that Church is the body of Christ, the habitation of God by the
Spirit, and that is comprised of all true believers, who had surrendered their
Lives, Souls, and Hearts, to Jesus, and allowed him to be Lord and savior of
their lives, and that, and they had kept on nurturing their vertical and
horizontal fellowship as an integral part of the body of Christ (Ephesians
1:22-23; 2:22, Hebrews 12:23.

                    We believe that Holy Spirit is one of the attributes of God and that he is our
helper, teacher, comforter, and a reminder of all things. He enables us to live
holy lives.

                            We do believe in baptism by emersion in much water. But this happens
                            after one has confessed to Christ and surrendered his/her life to the
                            Lord.

                            We do not celebrate marriages of persons whose gender is yet to be
